## Folder and Hierarchy Organization

Organize docs into folders and subfolders for better navigation. Create unlimited nesting levels.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workspace] --> B[Docs]
    A --> C[API]
    B --> D[Getting Started]
    B --> E[Features]
    D --> F[Quickstart]
    C --> G[Endpoints]
    G --> H[Users]
```

Drag and drop to reorder. Use folder permissions to control access.

## Search and Filtering

Locate documents instantly with Paperguide-pay's search bar. Filter by tags, authors, or dates.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full-Text Search" icon="search">
    Type keywords to search across all docs.

    Filters appear automatically: by folder, date range, or status.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Filters" icon="filter">
    Use operators like `tag:api` or `author:john`.

    Combine with `folder:docs` for precise results.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Control for Docs

Every change creates a new version. You view, compare, and revert history easily.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
  ````bash
  paperguide versions list --doc-id=doc_123
  paperguide versions revert --doc-id=doc_123 --version=v1.2
  ````
  ````javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/doc_123/versions', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  });
  const versions = await response.json();
  ````
</CodeGroup>
