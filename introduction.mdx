## Brand Guidelines

<Expandable title="Apply Your Brand Colors" default-open="true">

Use `{ #3B82F6 }` as your primary brand color for buttons, links, and accents. Pair it with neutral grays for text and white backgrounds.

In CSS:
````css
:root {
  --primary-color: {#3B82F6};
  --primary-hover: #2563EB;
}
````

This ensures consistency across your documentation.
